PROBLEM : ADD TWO NUMBERS 

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. 
The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. 
Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:
    2 -> 4 -> 3
    5 -> 6 -> 4
  ---------------
    7 -> 0 -> 8

Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
Example 2:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
Example 3:

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
